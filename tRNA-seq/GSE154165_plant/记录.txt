Title 	tRNA-seq and YAMAT-seq profiling the expressions of tRNA-derived fragments and tRNAs in plants
Organisms 	Arabidopsis thaliana; Glycine max; Hordeum vulgare; Setaria italica; Sorghum bicolor; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays
Experiment type 	Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing
Summary 	Here, we apply tRNA-seq and YAMAT-seq to profile the expressions of tRFs and tRNAs in plants. We provide a high-quality expression atlas of tRFs and tRNAs in Arabidopsis and rice, and uncover complex tRF population and the dynamic expressions of tRNA genes in plants.
  	
Overall design 	We constructed tRNA-seq and YAMAT-seq libraries from various plants. The tRNA-seq and YAMAT-seq methods were described previously (Cozen et al. 2015 Nat Methods; Zheng et al. 2015 Nat Methods; Shigematsu et al. Nucleic Acids Res.).
